        <h1>Welcome to HCI <br />(Human-Computer Interaction)</h1>
        <p>
          Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) explores the design and use of
          technology to create better experiences between humans and computers.
          In this course, you will learn about user-centered design principles,
          usability testing, and the interaction between technology and human
          behavior. Through weekly lectures and engaging content, you will build
          a strong understanding of HCI concepts.
